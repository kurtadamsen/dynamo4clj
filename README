# dynamo4clj

Clojure API for Amazon DynamoDB

## Usage

Put a file called aws.properties in src (or somewhere else where it ends up in the root of the classpath) with your aws keys in the format:

accessKey:blabla
secretKey:fooooo

Optionally put a config.properties file in src with the following optional parameters

proxy-host=sltarray
proxy-port=8080
region=dynamodb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

    (get-item "seq" "events_seq")

    (get-batch-items [["products" [1101001 1101101]] ["prices" [["ys" 1101001] ["kab" 1101201]]]])

    (delete-item "seq" "events_seq")

    (update-item "seq" "login_count" {:value [1 "add"]})

    (scan "events")

    (scan "events" [["author" "eq" "steen"]])

    (find-items "events" "NORMAL")   

    (find-items "events" "NORMAL" ["between" 715 815])

Range and conditions support

between,contains,eq,ge,gt,le,lt,ne,not-contains,not-null,null,begins-with

Check the Amazon docs for info on which conditions works for query. All should work for scan.
