    (get-item "seq" "events_seq")

    (delete-item "seq" "events_seq")

    (update-item "seq" "login_count" {:value [1 "add"]})

    (scan "events")

    (scan "events" [["author" "eq" "steen"]])

    (find-items "events" "NORMAL" true)   

    (find-items "events" "NORMAL" true ["between" 715 815])
